CONTIG: sequence_assemblee (16159bp)
Best alignment score: 456.0 (LEN: 457, IDY: 99.78), Total number of alignments: 52
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 52 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 9309.0, number of alignments: 52, unaligned bases: 6757
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 9402 out of 16159 non-N bases (58.18%))
