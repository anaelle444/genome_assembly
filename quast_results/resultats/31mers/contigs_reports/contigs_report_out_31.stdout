CONTIG: sequence_assemblee (14813bp)
Best alignment score: 344.0 (LEN: 344, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 60
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 60 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 8510.0, number of alignments: 60, unaligned bases: 6197
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 8616 out of 14813 non-N bases (58.17%))
