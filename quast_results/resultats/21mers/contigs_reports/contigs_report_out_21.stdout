CONTIG: sequence_assemblee (13725bp)
Best alignment score: 344.0 (LEN: 344, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 57
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 57 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 7766.0, number of alignments: 57, unaligned bases: 5866
		This contig is misassembled.
